## About Me

I turn real-world problems into **data-driven solutions** at the intersection of **cloud**, **edge AI**, and **IoT**. I focus on automation, infrastructure as code, and building systems that run reliably from the device to the cloud.

**Tech focus:** Azure · AWS · Terraform · Ansible · Python · CI/CD · Edge ML · Raspberry Pi · AWS IoT Greengrass

## Featured Project: Edge AI & Traffic Analytics

> *Turning real-life decisions into data, not assumptions.*

For a family business plan, we needed to understand **footfall and vehicle movement** before investing—so I built an end-to-end solution that collects, processes, and analyzes real-time traffic data using **edge devices** and **AWS**.

| Aspect | What I did |
|--------|------------|
| **Hardware** | Prototyped with ESP32-CAM, Raspberry Pi Zero, Jetson Nano; production on **Raspberry Pi 4** (power, size). |
| **Edge & ML** | Deployed **AWS IoT Greengrass**, ran ML inference on-device, fine-tuned detection and regions of interest. |
| **DevOps** | Configured services, users, permissions, and background execution; remote model updates and monitoring. |
| **Ops** | Solar-powered Pi, battery and device health monitoring, data pipelines—managed remotely. |

Being in a location with limited component access (e.g. 70 km trips for a single part) pushed me to plan carefully and iterate. The result: a scalable, data-driven system that informed a real business decision.
